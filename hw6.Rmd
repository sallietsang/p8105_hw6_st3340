#tidy data
lets import and clean the library first...
For  tidying data we have mainly two tasks: 
1.convert numeric to factor where appropriate
2.check for missing data

```{r}
#task 1 convert numeric to factor where appropriate
birthweight_df =read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()%>% 
  #convert babysex,frace,malform,mrace into factor and recode them 
  mutate( babysex= as.factor(babysex),
          frace= as.factor(frace),
          malform = as.factor(malform),
          mrace = as.factor(mrace))%>% 
  #babysex: babyâ€™s sex (male = 1, female = 2)
  mutate(babysex=  recode(babysex,"1" = "male","2"= "female"),
         frace= recode(frace,"1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other", "9" = "unknown"),
        malform=  recode(malform,"0" = "absent", "1" = "present" ),
        mrace = recode(mrace,"1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other")) %>% 
                           rename(dad_race = frace, mom_race = mrace)
  
#task 2  check for missing data
sum(is.na(birthweight_df))
```
There is no missing data in the birthweight dataframe.
